    <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>

    <p>
        Dear future me,<br/>
        I hope you've grown significantly in your tech journey. Remember those early days when JavaScript seemed daunting? Look how far you've come! Keep pushing boundaries, stay curious, and never stop learning. Your determination and hard work will have paid off by now. Most importantly, I hope you're still finding joy in coding while balancing it with your other passions.
